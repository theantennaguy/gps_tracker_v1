# gps_tracker_v1
 
This project is discontinued. I'm working on a new version, but so far it's only in the design phase.

The hardware project for this project is complete and functional. A board-bring-up was sucessfully performed and all is operational. The code was never completed, only basic functions for capturing GPS coordinates and sending SMSs, but I never got ot finish a working application for it.
